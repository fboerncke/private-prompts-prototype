# Status of "Private Prompts" Browser Extension

The user interface of "Private Prompts" has become increasingly complex during development, incorporating numerous features and popups. As a result, it no longer fits well within the context of a browser extension.

Therefore, we do not recommend using "Private Prompts" as a browser plugin in its current form. Our focus has shifted away from this approach. However, a simplified version of "Private Prompts" may be released as a browser plugin in the future.
