Current status: this is a project description for the application **Private Prompts**. An early **MVP** is work in progress and will be available on this page soon.

## About Private Prompts

Private Prompts is a powerful application for managing AI prompts directly on your device, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential and secure. With robust tools for handling data responsibly, users have complete control over what they consider private, enabling a personalized and secure prompt management experience.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Prompt Management**: Create, organize, and customize your prompts with ease.
- **You define what is private**: Use predefined rules or customize your own to identify sensitive information that you want to protect.
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Automatically detect and mask sensitive information within your prompts.
- **Interactive Workbench**: Refine your prompts and interact with AI services directly from the application.

Private Prompts is designed for AI enthusiasts, content creators, developers, marketers, students, and professionals. It prioritizes data privacy and customization. By operating offline, it ensures your sensitive data never leaves your device, enhancing security and streamlining workflows to boost productivity.

## Problem and Solution

In today's digital landscape, we often input personal information—such as CVs, letters, and private notes—into web applications, risking control over how that data is managed. Concerns arise:  
- Will my data be used to train future AI models?
- Will it be archived in ways I can't access?
- Could I face exposure in the event of a data breach?

Private Prompts addresses these challenges, allowing you to leverage powerful AI tools without compromising your data security. With our application, your information stays local, empowering you to work with confidence.

### Pseudonymizing Sensitive Prompts

Below is an example of a prompt containing sensitive information and its pseudonymized version.

```html
<!-- Input Prompt with Sensitive Data -->
Create a personalized cover letter for Frank Börncke
(email: frank.boerncke@gmail.com) applying for the 
Senior Developer position at TechCorp, emphasizing his experience 
with proprietary systems and confidential project details.

<!-- Pseudonymized Prompt -->
Create a personalized cover letter for John Doe 
(email: john.doe@yahoo.com) applying for the 
Senior Developer position at TechCorp, emphasizing his experience 
with proprietary systems and confidential project details.
```

Once you create a pseudonymized prompt, you can easily input it into a web application for translation or AI processing. In the next step, Private Prompts will assist you in de-pseudonymizing the output, seamlessly replacing the temporary placeholders with your actual data.

This process allows you to obtain responses that include your sensitive information without it ever leaving your device, ensuring your data remains safe and confidential from any third-party access.

## Key Features

### Protect Your Privacy

Protect your sensitive information with simple-to-use masking and pseudonymization techniques. Since everything is processed on your device, your data stays private and won't be used for training AI in the future.

### Stay in Control

Utilize masking features to anonymize sensitive information within your prompts. Establish custom rules for data handling to ensure your privacy without sacrificing functionality. Your data is stored locally on your device, safeguarding it from unauthorized access and potential breaches.

### Safeguard What Matters to You

Private Prompts empowers you to define what sensitive information means for you. While we provide predefined rules to guide you, you can easily adjust them to match your personal preferences, ensuring your privacy is in your control.

### Track Your Progress

Keep track of all your interactions to manage them easily over time, helping to streamline your workflow. You can look back at what you’ve done to optimize how you use prompts and quickly delete anything private with a single click.

### Organize Your Prompts

Private Prompts comes with a built-in Prompt Manager that makes organizing all your prompts a breeze. You can easily assign tags by platform or customize them to suit your specific needs for quick access. Each prompt features a title and a comment section, enabling fast identification and allowing you to add extra notes to enhance your organizational strategy.

### Quick Access to Your Essentials

Easily mark the prompts you use most often as favorites so you can access them quickly when needed. This feature allows you to find your key prompts fast, saving you time and effort in your workflow.

### Seamless Data Transfer

Effortlessly import your existing prompts and export them in JSON format for backups or sharing across devices, all while keeping your privacy intact. You decide which prompts are allowed to leave your browser, making it simple to transfer your data securely.

### Enhance Your AI Experience

This optional feature allows you to connect effortlessly with AI services like OpenAI for generating and managing prompts within your secure local environment. You can enhance your AI interactions while keeping your data safe. If you prefer to take extra precautions, you can also copy and paste your prompts to a separate space to sandbox your data.

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case: Drafting Legal Documents

Challenge: Creating initial drafts of legal documents while safeguarding sensitive information.

Solution: Legal professionals frequently draft documents such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that include confidential client information. Private Prompts ensures that these elements are masked, preventing unintended exposure.

```html
<!-- Input Prompt with Sensitive Data -->
Draft a non-disclosure agreement between new employee (Alice Johnson) and 
InnovateX Inc., including clauses on intellectual property and 
confidentiality.

<!-- Pseudonymized Prompt -->
Draft a non-disclosure agreement between new employee (Jane Doe) and 
SomeCompany Inc., including clauses on intellectual property and 
confidentiality.
```

### Use Case: Real Estate Property Description

Challenge: Protecting the confidentiality of address information.

Solution: When creating real estate listings, sharing precise addresses can pose privacy risks. Private Prompts addresses this by masking sensitive details such as property addresses.

```html

Create a real estate listing for my property located at 
123 Maple Street, Springfield, IL 62704, featuring 
4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, and a spacious backyard.

<!-- Pseudonymized Prompt -->

456 Oak Avenue, Spring City, MA 12345, featuring 
4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, and a spacious backyard.
```

### Use Case: Customer Support Response Generation

regarding his issue with the XYZ Pro software crashing during use.

```

### Use Case: Banking Transaction Summary
